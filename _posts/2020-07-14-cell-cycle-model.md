Cell cycle is an elaborate orchestration of colossal molecules in the elaborate cell machine. Analogous to the central theorem, genetic code to protein expression and phenotypes as molecular interactions to cell cycle progression, which means there can be two kinds of studies that meat each halfway:



1. Study of protein interaction dynamics during the cell cycle - to discuss how certain group of proteins contribute to an overall function. For example, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.034">Nurse group, 2016</a> has provided proteomic evidence about the dependence of driving kinase - substrate interaction on substrate activity.
2. Study of cell cycle progression kinetics - to characterize key events (checkpoints, commitment points, etc.) and predict the existence of functional proteins.

If we are able to establish a working cell cycle model based on defined protein interactions, then we are confident that we have interpreted the protein function correctly. If the model cannot capture cell cycle features, commonly the case, a _refinement_ of the model with more parameters, different kinetic formulas i.e., modelling approaches may reveal undiscovered features. However, a formula with unresolved _biological meaning_ is exposed to critics (e.g. over-fitting).

[A recent research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2017.09.015) has concluded unique DNA damage response kinetics in consecutive cell cycle phases (G1, S and G2/M) through modeling the time length of these phases. Two questions haunted me when reading through the paper:

- How to characterize various differences concluded in a more statistical way? What are true differences and what can be artifacts.
- How can we fathom the biological nature of model parameters?

## Binomial, Poisson, Exponential and Gamma distribution

Just as the organization of four cell cycle phases, each phase is viewed as a combination of **$k$ sub-steps**. Each sub-step posses a binary outcome: succeed or fail to progress into next step. The intrinsic kinetics of the phases, perturbation of the cell cycle manifests as the variance of time taken by these steps. Hence, cell cycle phases are modeled as a **Poisson process**, an extension of Binomial distribution with regard of _time_.
<br/>
The probability of obtaining $n$ binary outcomes (number of success) from $n$ Bernoulli trials follows Binomial distribution is

$$\begin{gather}
PMF_{B(n, p)} = P(X = k) = \tbinom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\ 
EX = pn
\end{gather}$$

Let's consider number of success within unit time. If we are able to perform as many trails as possible within unit time, our result will be close to the expectation $pn$. Distribution of number of success within time T will be a **Poisson distribution**

$$PMF_{Poi(k,\lambda_T)} = P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda_T^k}{k!}e^{-\lambda_T}$$

where $\lambda_T = pn$, an estimated number of success within time T, a.k.a, **arrival rate** (imaging cars arriving the toll gate on the highway).

In essence, **Poisson process** describes the _increase of number of success_ within certain time interval $t$. By simply replacing $\lambda_T$ with $\lambda * t$

$$P(X_{t_0+t} - X_{t_0} = k) = \frac{(\lambda * t)^k}{k!}e^{-\lambda*t}$$

It can be deduced that time taken for the cell to progress from $k_i$ to $k_{i+1}$ follows **Exponential distribution**

$$\begin{gather}PDF_{Exp(\lambda)} = P(T_{k_i \to k_{i+1}} > t) = e^{-\lambda t}\\
ET = \frac{1}{\lambda}
\end{gather}$$

Note: discrete $k$ corresponding to probability mass function while continuous $t$ to probability density function.

To aggregate all $k$ steps together; time taken by the whole phase can be modeled with **Gamma distribution**

$$\begin{gather}
PDF_{\Gamma(k,\theta)} = P(T_{\sum{k_i}} > t) = \frac{1}{(k-1)!\theta^k}t^{k-1}e^{-\frac{t}{\theta}}\\
ET = k\theta = k/\lambda
\end{gather}$$

where $k$ is known as the shape parameter and $\theta$ is the scale parameter. Importantly, $\theta = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ as in exponential distribution.

Note: $\frac{1}{\theta} = \lambda$ is also known as the rate parameter $\beta$ in combination with the shape parameter $\alpha = k$.

## A basic cell cycle time model in response to DNA damage
In the primarily model suggested by the research, DNA damage induced by neocarzinostatin (NCS) is regarded as an intermediate event that does not have long-lasting effects. As described, cells either arrest for a while: $t_{halt} \sim Gaussian(\mu, \mu/3)$, or exit the cell cycle with the probability $p$ after NCS treatment. The cell cycle stage of a cell in the asynchronous population is indicated by the fraction parameter $f \sim Uniform(0,1)$. The overall time of cell cycle is estimated by Gamma distribution as discussed above. The post-damage time is given as
$$
T_{post\_damage} = 
\begin{cases}
\sim Gamma(k, \lambda) \times (1-f) + t_{halt}, \scriptsize\text{with the probability}\, 1-p\\
\infty, \scriptsize\text{with the probability}\, p
\end{cases}
$$
where $k$, $\lambda$, $\mu$ and $p$ are cell cycle phase-dependent parameters and therefore estimated.

Note: Viewing drug adminstration as a single event is the main weak point of the study. This inevitable foible when experimenting with drugs can make kinetics or LOF studies less predictable. Therefore, a shape, switch-like manipulation is desirable (e.g. [auxin-inducible degron system (AID)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0512-x)).

## Model refinement
The figure below taken from the manuscript shows two discrepancies between model fitting (bottom) and the observation (two). 
1. In G1 and G2/M phases, the cumulative distribution curves representing NCS treatment at  increasing level converges at first (the _"initial rise"_) and then diverges as predicted, which means there is always a population of cells _escape_ from DNA damage response.
2. In S phase, the prediction curve has a 50% _right shift_ compared with the observation as claimed, indicating a _slow-down_ kinetics instead of all-or-none halt.

Two rectifications of the model were made respectively
1. For each phase, introduce the time point named **commitment point** $I_{cp}$. Cells that have already passed through this point show no response to DNA damage.
2. For S phase, instead of modeling all-or-none arrest by $t_{halt}$, a slow-down kinetics is modeled by Gamma distribution with decreased rate parameter $\lambda$.

The ultimate model given by the study is

$$\begin{gather}
f \sim Uniform(0,1)\\
t_{halt} \sim Gaussian(\mu, \mu/3)\\
T_{\text{post damage transition time in $X$}} = 
\begin{cases}
\small\sim Gamma(k, \lambda) \times (1-f) + t_{halt}, \scriptsize\,X \in \{G1, G2/M\}, f<I_{cp}, Prob = 1-p\\
\small\sim Gamma(k, \lambda_{slow}) \times (1-f),\scriptsize\, X = S, f<I_{cp}, Prob = 1-p\\
\small\infty, \scriptsize\,X \in \{G1, G2/M, S\}, f<I_{cp}, Prob = p\\
\small\sim Gamma(k, \lambda) \times (1-f), \scriptsize\,X \in \{G1, G2/M\}, f \ge I_{cp}\\
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$

## Conclusions & Comments
A bunch of important messages can be drawn by interpreting fitted model parameters in combination with biological evidence described in the paper.
- Cells undergo all-or-none arrest in G1/G2 when suffering from DNA damage, evidenced by switch-like cyclin/CDK activity mediated by various molecules
- DNA damage checkpoint in S phase is graded, evidenced by late-origin firing inhibition and dominant origin mechanism. It is inferred by the author that less-stringent S phase checkpoint allows cell to progress with replication mistakes and therefore indicating G2 is a better target for cell cycle-based therapy.
- G2 commitment point detected by the model is at the boundary between G2 and M (0.5h before M entry), which is more strict than G1 (3~4h before S entry). The nature of G2 commitment point may resides in an array of events happening around 0.5h before mitosis (e.g. [positive feedback loop of cyclin B1/CDK1 translocation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.028)).

From my perspective, the discovery of **commitment point** in a computational flavour is more intriguing than two distinct kinetics. Table S2 & S3 of the paper only show little decrease (even increase in 6/10 cases) of model-observation-difference after applying graded-slow-down model to S phase, thus require more concrete, biological evidence. On the other hand, the recurrence of population that escape DNA damage is definitive. Overall, the paper demonstrates the complete logic of computational modeling, its application and interpretation that may spark the venture into much more biological natures.
